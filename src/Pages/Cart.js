      Advantages of Material UI Ship faster: Over 2,500 open-source contributors
      have poured countless hours into these components. Focus on your core
      business logic instead of reinventing the wheel—we've got your UI covered.
      Beautiful by default: We're meticulous about our implementation of
      Material Design, ensuring that every Material UI component meets the
      highest standards of form and function, but diverge from the official spec
      where necessary to provide multiple great options. Customizability: The
      library includes an extensive set of intuitive customizability features.
      The templates in our store demonstrate how far you can go with
      customization. Cross-team collaboration: Material UI's intuitive developer
      experience reduces the barrier to entry for back-end developers and less
      technical designers, empowering teams to collaborate more effectively. The
      design kits streamline your workflow and boost consistency between
      designers and developers. Trusted by thousands of organizations: Material
      UI has the largest UI community in the React ecosystem. It's almost as old
      as React itself—its history stretches back to 2014—and we're in this for
      the long haul. You can count on the community's support for years to come
      (e.g. Stack Overflow).
